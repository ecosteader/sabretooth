# Ecosteader's instance of Mastodon

This fork of the `tootsuite/mastodon/` repo to continue the work that was started 
with the original `indie/spacemin` RoR site ... development on this fork will likely 
follow the Apache-friendly ways. Please help share ECOLOGICAL DEMOCRACY that may 
someday heal the planet. 

Note:  Anyone working for EVIL SALESFORCE or Twitter or Heroku is NOT WELCOME HERE; 
your code will be deleted and your IPs will be banned from the network.

## About Ecosteader

Ecosteader is a network for builders, designers, and innovators of "green" or 
eco-friendly habitats, gardens, homesteads, farms, artwork, and more. We share 
ideas and inspirations with a friendly hippie environmentalist kinda vibe.

Ecosteading is like homesteading, but it's meant to be done on a much smaller, 
more humble, more efficient scale; unlike traditional homesteading, it can be 
done with any amount of land or space -- in either urban and rural settings. 
Ecosteading is also about acknowledging that humans are but one user of shared 
soil. This philosophy is sometimes called Community Ecology.

[Get Started Ecosteading](https://github.com/indie/ecosteader/blob/master/START-Lot-Plan-Considerations-Ecosteader)

Being an Ecosteader involves systems-level thinking. With the advent of AI and 
technology, we know that smart systems require networking, and in order to best 
take a systems-level approach, people need to network. But wait! We're not talking 
about "networking" the traditional greed-driven ways that have driven the last 
200 years of American real estate "development".

## We are anti-Realtors, [anti-landlords](https://web.archive.org/web/20181115214908/https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/9xbic8/landlords_suck/), and against corrupt politicians.

### Ecological Democracy begins locally

Instead, we endorse owner-occupied ecosteads, with practical, simple, and 
earth-friendly stewardship of lands including nature preservation areas, 
habitat restoration areas, and America's public lands. We're supportive of 
efforts in county-level infrastructure, where laws and shared community 
vision and goals can be articulated and implemented by the residents and 
voters themselves through democratic processes. We are also staunchly 
anti-HOA; HOAs divert what would otherwise be publicly-accountable taxpayer 
dollars into privately-managed coffers with no accountability, often forcing 
residents to be governed under rules and bylaws that promote gerrymandering 
and exclusionary zoning that is harmful to ecosystems (think golf courses 
and walls). They also destroy community spirit.

This Mastodon instance run by Ecosteader & Company, a registered Public 
Benefit with a non-profit mission: to raise awareness of the ecological 
and economical benefits of ecosteading. We help people escape the slavery 
of rent and work around the greedy actors in real estate by providing them 
with tools, resources, and information they need to make their own contracts 
and cut out corrupt middlemen.

* **Don't get scammed by Realtors** It's NEVER a good idea invite a Realtor 
  or realty brokerage affiliate to your property. An agent that tells you 
  any forms or terms on a contract are "standard" or "not negotiable" -- 
  *especially* the usage of a percent as a commission -- can and should be 
  sued for coercion! Remember: it's YOU hiring THEM, not the other way 
  around.  See also: https://old.reddit.com/r/RealtorsSuck/

Mastodon is a **free, open-source social network server** based on ActivityPub. Follow friends and discover new ones. Publish anything you want: links, pictures, text, video. All servers of Mastodon are interoperable as a federated network, i.e. users on one server can seamlessly communicate with users from another one. This includes non-Mastodon software that also implements ActivityPub!

## Features

<img src="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/elephant.svg" align="right" width="30%" />

**No vendor lock-in: Fully interoperable with any conforming platform**

It doesn't have to be Mastodon, whatever implements ActivityPub is part of the social network! [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/why-activitypub-is-the-future/)

**Real-time, chronological timeline updates**

See the updates of people you're following appear in real-time in the UI via WebSockets. There's a firehose view as well!

**Media attachments like images and short videos**

Upload and view images and WebM/MP4 videos attached to the updates. Videos with no audio track are treated like GIFs; normal videos are looped - like vines!

**Safety and moderation tools**

Private posts, locked accounts, phrase filtering, muting, blocking and all sorts of other features, along with a reporting and moderation system. [Learn more](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/)

**OAuth2 and a straightforward REST API**

Mastodon acts as an OAuth2 provider so 3rd party apps can use the REST and Streaming APIs, resulting in a rich app ecosystem with a lot of choice!

## Deployment

**Tech stack:**

- **Ruby on Rails** powers the REST API and other web pages
- **React.js** and Redux are used for the dynamic parts of the interface
- **Node.js** powers the streaming API

**Requirements:**

- **PostgreSQL** 9.5+
- **Redis**
- **Ruby** 2.4+
- **Node.js** 8+

 The [**stand-alone** installation guide](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/administration/installation/) is available in the documentation.

A **Vagrant** configuration is included for development purposes.
