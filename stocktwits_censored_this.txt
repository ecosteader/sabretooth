$INTC Anybody bearish on this stock is a terrorist.  

Seriously.    


Why be bearish on the most uh, "per capita" headcount of Linux maintainers in the 
continental region known as "North America", "South America", "Africa", "Japan" 

People who hate Intel are like ... Zuck bombing the rare and endangered Palestine 
peoples so he can raise his "Middle East" flag of religion and oppress the existing 
indigenous peoples on both sides of the glob.  

He's razor-wired, fenced, gated and surrounded the indigenous people with Terrorism 
on both sides of the globe.
