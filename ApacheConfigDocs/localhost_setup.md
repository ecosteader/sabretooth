[pgbouncer] is a PostgreSQL connection pooler. Any target application can be connected to 
pgbouncer as if it were a PostgreSQL server, and pgbouncer will create a connection to the 
actual server, or it will reuse one of its existing connections. The aim of pgbouncer is 
to lower the performance impact of opening new connections to PostgreSQL, which can help 
your server. pgBouncer is a transparent proxy for PostgreSQL that provides pooling based on database transactions, rather than sessions. That has the benefit that a real database connection is not needlessly occupied while a thread is doing nothing with it. Mastodon supports pgBouncer, you simply need to connect to it instead of PostgreSQL, and set the environment variable PREPARED_STATEMENTS=false
