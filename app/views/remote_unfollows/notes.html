<h1>The Problem: Real Estate Is Broken</h1>

<h2><a href="http://www.ecosteader.com/alternative">Let's attack the root of the problem.</a></h2>

<p><strong>Fact:</strong> Empowering a diverse mix of people with unencumbered ownership WILL ensure the ecological health of homes and neighborhoods, and build economic prosperity for everyone who lives in and around Portland Metro.</p>

<p><strong>First!</strong> Some background... and why Realtors are the root of nefarious evil.</p>

         
<p>Real estate agents are <strong>not</strong> economists with special 
insights about any market. They are not professional carpenters. They are not 
CPAs. They are not plumbers. They are not JD degree-holding attorneys. They 
are not concrete laborers, or electricians, or licensed home inspectors. So 
why is it that they are allowed to get away with stealing your earned equity 
and life savings?</p>

<p>Realtors are <strong>lobbyists</strong> whose business is based on coercion 
and what essentially amounts to contract fraud. They accomplish their 
thievery with very underhanded  tactics: collusion with other agents and 
brokerages, kickbacks to title companies they hold significant interest in, 
and with aggressive, expensive lobbying for complex laws. The National 
Association of Realtors (NAR) does claim it has a supposed code of "ethics"; 
however, that code is akin to the code of the KKK. There is nothing ethical about the NAR's code.</p>

<p>The unfortunate reality is that Realtors "get away" with stealing your 
equity <em>because you let them.</em> They assume that you are
<strong>stupid</strong>, feed anxieties and stress around home purchases and 
selling, and will do <strong>anything</strong> and everything 
to coerce and trap you into signing one of <strong>their</strong> contracts -- 
their forms on their terms, thus guaranteeing them the legal "right" to 
abscond with your equity.</p> 

<p>People just don't know that for about 99.75 percent of the (residential) 
sales that happen in the USA, it is better, safer, and orders of magnitude 
less costly to hire an attorney that works on documents for a 
<strong>flat fee </strong> than it is to engage anybody associated with the 
Realtor cartel.  This is a fact that Realtors try desperately to 
hide. </p>   


<h2>More Renters Than Ever</h2>
<h3>A Perfect Correlation to Lobbying</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the negative effects of the Realtor cartel are bleeding out 
and affecting people who don't own. In addition to hyping up "the market" to 
make bigger commissions, many real estate agencies participate in the 
immensely profitable business of leasing rental properties for profit, as 
a means to extract wealth from low-income families. The rental side of real 
estate is crippled and broken, too: landlord companies have devised a system 
where they coerce people into signing long-term
contracts that force them to give up their <strong>future earnings
</strong>.</p>   

<p>An illustration of the facts is that we are currently at <a href="http://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf">the lowest percent of 
ownership in almost 50 years</a> across the entire USA. Renting has become so 
profitable that many real estate companies handle property management only: 
crippling renters' ability to save while enslaving them to ever-increasing
rents. People who spend the largest portion of their earnings on rent have 
a nearly impossible situation when attempting to save enough to buy.</p>

<h1>Oregonians being targeted to be defrauded</h1>

<h3>Problems Specific To Portland</h3>

<p>Oregon's supposedly "professional" brokerages and agent Realtors have 
crafted a complex system to defraud those who are too afraid to sell FSBO. 
They feed fears and exaggerate the dangers of direct buyer-seller sales. Their 
business model gives them ALL REWARD with NO RISK.   </p>

<p>So how do Oregon Realtors extort good people out of their earned equity and 
life savings?  
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/competition-and-real-estate-state-2">The US Department of Justice</a> has the facts.</p>

<p>Let's do a quick calculation on a hypothetical example of a Realtor-priced 
home in Portland Metro (Source: Zillow / 09-2016).  To find out just how long
it takes a family to earn $16,416 of equity in their home, calculate the cost 
of the interest PLUS the principal.  Six percent of an "average" sale may not 
seem like much in exchange for what they are telling you your property may be 
worth; however when you look closer at the numbers, the truth emerges. The 
<strong>you're actually paying over $53,837</strong>, and it you took 40 months to earn that $16.4K of Equity. Likewise, it will take the new owner 3 and a
half years before they earn even a penny of their own equity. Realtors have 
<strong>full knowledge</strong> of their theft... in fact their knowledge of 
and exploitation of this loophole is what caused the <a href="https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis">subprime mortgage crisis</a>, 
which cost taxpayers billions of dollars.</p>  

<p>Unfortunately, there are no laws out there to protect Oregonians from the
predatory, unethical behavior of these . On the contrary, there's currently 
what can only be described as an <a href="http://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/696.290">insane</a> provision in <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/REA/Pages/Index.aspx">Oregon Realtor Code</a> that actually <strong>prevents</strong> them from returning the money to the parties exchanging value. Even when, say, 
the seller needed an accelerated sale and to have their property sold in one 
day!  Try to calculate the cost of the Realtors per-hour, and it is nearly 
impossible to justify the "value" of their involvement.  Indeed, the only way 
to ensure this insane law doesn't defraud you is to prohibit
Realtors from the sale at all points.  There are plenty of places you can
sell FSBO free, including <a href="https://portland.craigslist.org/search/reo">Craigslist REO</a>. </p>

<h1>The Solution:  A little, local company with a big vision </h1>

<p> Ecosteader is tackling the problem from many angles.  The solution to get rid of the 
stranglehold Realtors have on the system will be radical. It
will involve more than banishing middlemen agents from our transactions.  It will 
require building more "for sale" units than "for rent" units... and our vision is to do this by localizing labor:  we have a database of workers ready to build Portland's neighborhoods into places that increase value for everybody... no more arguing through the Realtors about which "side" should pay for what.</p>

<p> It will require a crackdown on privately-owned HOAs that are becoming rampant
in Portland's metro ... most cities already have
infrastructures and laws, laws and regulations that taxpayers have actually 
voted on. </p>

<p>Empowering a diverse mix of people with unencumbered ownership 
WILL ensure the ecological health of homes and neighborhoods, and build 
economic prosperity for everyone who lives in and around Portland Metro.  </p>
